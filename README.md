# Post-Stroke-Rehabilitation-Device
Designed and prototyped a wearable post-stroke rehabilitation device to alleviate wrist and hand contractures that hinder finger movement. This innovative solution leveraged mechanical, electrical, and software components to facilitate repetitive finger flexion and extension, while prioritizing safety and comfort for effective rehabilitation.

## Problem Space
The primary purpose of this project was designing and prototyping a rehabilitation device that helps post-stroke patients regain normal finger dexterity. Post-stroke patients often find their wrists in constant flexion so the designed solution’s rehabilitation method will focus on finger extension to the top and flexion back to the original resting position. Furthermore, the rehabilitation device prototype will track the number of exercise repetitions completed by the patient, making it easy for a physiotherapist or occupational therapist to monitor the patient’s recovery progress. There is a crucial need for such a device as a significant percentage of stroke patients, ranging from 65% to 85%, experience only a partial recovery in the use of their upper limb.
